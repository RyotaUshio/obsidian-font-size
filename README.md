# Obsidian Font Size Adjuster

This [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds the `Increment font size` & `Decrement font size` commands,
which allows you to adjust font size from hotkeys or the command palette without opening the appearance settings.

Note that they are different from Obsidian's built-in `Zoom in` & `Zoom out` commands; while these zooming commands
change the size of all UI elements, the `Increment font size` & `Decrement font size` commands only affect the editor font size.

I recommend the following hotkeys (in the case of macOS with a US-layout keyboard):
- `Zoom in`: `Cmd`+`=`
- `Zoom out`: `Cmd`+`-`
- `Increment font size`: `Cmd`+`Shift`+`=`
- `Decrement font size`: `Cmd`+`Shift`+`-`
