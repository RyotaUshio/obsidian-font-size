## Installation

Since this plugin is still awaiting approval from the Obsidian team, it's not available in the community plugin browser yet.

But you can install the latest release using [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

1. Install the latest version of BRAT and enable it.
2. _(Optional but highly recommended)_ In the BRAT settings, turn on `Auto-update plugins at startup` at the top of the page.
3. Open the following URL in the browser: `obsidian://brat?plugin=RyotaUshio/obsidian-font-size`.
4. Click the "Add Plugin" button.
